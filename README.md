Little Point:
We implemented a nice visualization to get the input from the users, nevertheless if the libraries **ipywidgets** and **plotly** are not installed you cannot see it.
Therefore we made a simple screen that represents how it would look like.
If you don't want to download it, just give a value to the variables.
